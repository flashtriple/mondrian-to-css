Interested in dev, science & art.
Im taking expertise in frontend 
development as freelance service 
for a company.
Im learning about flutter and other 
stuff, like php frameworks for team 
work, but i preffer pure code to 
master and optimize at maximum the 
fileweight, i really care about 
that to develop fast reading code 
and users get the best possible user 
experience.
