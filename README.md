Fullstack developer interested in 
dev, science, music & art.
Im taking expertise in frontend 
development as freelance service 
for a company.
Im learning about flutter & other 
stuff, like php frameworks for team 
work, but i preffer pure code to 
master and optimize at maximum the 
fileweight, i really care about 
that to develop fast reading code 
& users get the best possible 
experience.
